# Render Layers

Layers are settings that users can change according to their game.

---

## RenderLayer

Render layers control the draw order of sprites. Layers are drawn in ascending order — layer 0 is drawn first (bottom), the highest layer is drawn last (top). See [Renderer](../core-systems/renderer.md) for how layers fit into the rendering pipeline.

---

## ColliderLayer

`CollisionLayer` defines the **collision categories** of game objects. Each layer is a **bitmask**, allowing fast layer-to-layer collision checks using bitwise operations.

---

## Default Layers

```cpp
enum class RenderLayer {
    BackGround = 0,
    World      = 1,
    Entities   = 2,
    Player     = 3,
    FX         = 4,
    MAX_LAYERS   // always last — automatically equals layer count
};

enum class CollisionLayer : uint16_t {
    DEFAULT    = 1 << 0,
    Player     = 1 << 1,
    Enemy      = 1 << 2,
    Wall       = 1 << 3,
    Trigger    = 1 << 4,
    Projectile = 1 << 5
    // user can add more
};
```

---

## Usage

Pass a layer when creating a sprite:

```cpp
SpriteRenderer sr = SpriteRenderer(this, &playerSprite, PALETTE_WARM, static_cast<int>(RenderLayer::Player));
```

See [Sprite Renderer](../gameobjects-and-components/sprite-renderer.md) for more details.

## Customizing Layers

You can rename, add, or remove layers freely to match your game. The only rule is `MAX_LAYERS` must always be the last entry — it is used internally by the engine to know how many layers to manage and will automatically equal the layer count.

```cpp
enum class RenderLayer {
    Background = 0,
    Player     = 1,
    MAX_LAYERS  // always last
};
```

For bitmask layers do not add MAX_LAYERS:

```cpp
enum class CollisionLayer : uint16_t {
    DEFAULT    = 1 << 0,
    BigShac    = 1 << 1,
    Sputni     = 1 << 2,
    Cgurna     = 1 << 3,
};
```

## Memory

Each Render layer costs `MAX_GAME_OBJECTS * 4` bytes of RAM. With 6 layers and 64 max objects that is `6 * 64 * 4 = 1536 bytes`. Remove unused layers if RAM is tight.
